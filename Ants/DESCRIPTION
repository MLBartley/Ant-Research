Description: This package takes ant trophallaxis interaction files
    provided by the David Hughes Entomology Lab at The Pennsylvania 
    State University and provides the following functions: 
    data prep, data simulation, data visualization, and parameter 
    estimation within different Hidden Markov models. Functions 
    contained within this package are inspired by my work on my first
    project of my Statistics PhD thesis.
