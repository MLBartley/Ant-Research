abstract = {Algae have significant potential as a source of biomass for the production of biofuels, due to their high growth rates and high cellular lipid content. Studies that address the use of algae as biofuels often require the frequent measurement of algal lipid content. Traditional methods for the quantification of lipid are, however, costly if sub-contracted, or involve the use of expensive analytical equipment that is not available in many labs. This study describes a simple, colorimetric method for the quantification of algal lipid from small amounts of culture. The technique is derived from a method for the quantification of fatty acids dissolved in chloroform. Algal lipids are saponified to fatty acids and then mixed with a copper reagent. Chloroform-extractable copper soaps of long-chain fatty acids are then colorimetrically measured by the addition of diethyldithiocarbamate to develop a yellow colored product. Linear responses for fatty acids in the range of C10:0 to C16:0 were observed for a concentration range between 0.025 and 1 micromol of fatty acid per 200 microL of sample. Fatty acids with chain lengths of less than twelve carbons produced significantly reduced signal. Decenoic acid yielded a slightly, but significantly lower signal than decanoic acid indicating that the assay underestimates the presence of unsaturated fatty acids. Lipid contents of Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Chlorella vulgaris CM2 were monitored for eight days during exponential growth to demonstrate the feasibility of the technique as a monitoring methodology. Overall, the method allowed reliable detection and quantification of fatty acid content from 1 to 2 mL of algal culture. Adaptation of the technique to micro-centrifuge format allows assaying 30 samples in less than 2h. Considering reagents and time, the total cost per assay was estimated at less than {\$}5, representing a significant cost savings over traditional lipid quantification procedures.},

abstract = {Continued use of petroleum sourced fuels is now widely recognized as unsustainable because of depleting supplies and the contribution of these fuels to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the environment. Renewable, carbon neutral, transport fuels are necessary for environmental and economic sustainability. Biodiesel derived from oil crops is a potential renewable and carbon neutral alternative to petroleum fuels. Unfortunately, biodiesel from oil crops, waste cooking oil and animal fat cannot realistically satisfy even a small fraction of the existing demand for transport fuels. As demonstrated here, microalgae appear to be the only source of renewable biodiesel that is capable of meeting the global demand for transport fuels. Like plants, microalgae use sunlight to produce oils but they do so more efficiently than crop plants. Oil productivity of many microalgae greatly exceeds the oil productivity of the best producing oil crops. Approaches for making microalgal biodiesel economically competitive with petrodiesel are discussed.},

abstract = {The relationships between areal (g m(-2) per day) and volumetric (g l(-1) per day) productivity of Nannochloropsis sp. as affected by the light-path (ranging from 1.3 to 17.0 cm) of a vertical flat plate glass photobioreactor were elucidated. In general, the shorter the length of the light-path (LP), the smaller the areal volume and the higher the volumetric productivity. The areal productivity in relation to the light-path, in contrast, yielded an optimum curve, the highest areal productivity was obtained in a 10 cm LP reactor, which is regarded, therefore, optimal for mass production of Nannochloropsis. An attempt was made to identify criteria by which to assess the efficiency of a photobioreactor in utilizing strong incident energy. Two basic factors which relate to reactor efficiency and its cost-effectiveness have been defined as (a) the total illuminated surface required to produce a set quantity of product and (b) culture volume required to produce that quantity. As a general guide line, the lower these values are, the more efficient and cost-effective the reactor would be. An interesting feature of this analysis rests with the fact that an open raceways is as effective in productivity per illuminated area as a flat-plate reactor with an optimal light path, both cultivation systems requiring ca. 85 m(2) of illuminated surface to produce 1 kg dry cell mass of Nannochloropsis sp. per day. The difference in light utilization efficiency between the two very different production systems involves three aspects - first, the open raceway requires ca. 6 times greater volume than the 10 cm flat plate reactor to produce the same quantity of cell-mass. Second, the total ground area (i.e. including the ground area between reactors) for the vertical flat plate reactor is less than one half of that occupied by an open raceway, indicating the former is more efficient, photosynthetically, compared with the latter. Finally, the harvested cell density is close to one order of magnitude higher in the flat plate reactor, which carries economic significance. The advantage of vertical lamination of photoautotrophic cells provided by vertical plate reactors, is thereby clearly seen. The optimal population density (i.e. which results in the highest areal productivity) in the 10 cm plate reactor was obtained by a daily harvest of 10{\%} of culture volume, yielding an annual average of ca. 12.1 g dry wt. m(-2) per day (on the basis of the overall illuminated reactor surfaces, i.e. front and back) or 240 mg l(-1) per day.},

abstract = {Sustainability is a key principle in natural resource management, and it involves operational efficiency, minimisation of environmental impact and socio-economic considerations; all of which are interdependent. It has become increasingly obvious that continued reliance on fossil fuel energy resources is unsustainable, owing to both depleting world reserves and the green house gas emissions associated with their use. Therefore, there are vigorous research initiatives aimed at developing alternative renewable and potentially carbon neutral solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels as alternative energy resources. However, alternate energy resources akin to first generation biofuels derived from terrestrial crops such as sugarcane, sugar beet, maize and rapeseed place an enormous strain on world food markets, contribute to water shortages and precipitate the destruction of the world's forests. Second generation biofuels derived from lignocellulosic agriculture and forest residues and from non-food crop feedstocks address some of the above problems; however there is concern over competing land use or required land use changes. Therefore, based on current knowledge and technology projections, third generation biofuels specifically derived from microalgae are considered to be a technically viable alternative energy resource that is devoid of the major drawbacks associated with first and second generation biofuels. Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms with simple growing requirements (light, sugars, CO2, N, P, and K) that can produce lipids, proteins and carbohydrates in large amounts over short periods of time. These products can be processed into both biofuels and valuable co-products. This study reviewed the technologies underpinning microalgae-to-biofuels systems, focusing on the biomass production, harvesting, conversion technologies, and the extraction of useful co-products. It also reviewed the synergistic coupling of microalgae propagation with carbon sequestration and wastewater treatment potential for mitigation of environmental impacts associated with energy conversion and utilisation. It was found that, whereas there are outstanding issues related to photosynthetic efficiencies and biomass output, microalgae-derived biofuels could progressively substitute a significant proportion of the fossil fuels required to meet the growing energy demand.},

abstract = {Neutral lipids are stored in the cytosol in so-called lipid droplets. These are dynamic organelles with neutral lipids as the core surrounded by a monolayer of amphipathic lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol) and specific proteins (PAT proteins and proteins involved in the turnover of lipids and in the formation and trafficking of the droplets). Lipid droplets are formed at microsomal membranes as primordial droplets with a diameter of 0.1-0.4 microm and increase in size by fusion. In this article, we review the assembly and fusion of lipid droplets, and the processes involved in the secretion of triglycerides. Triglycerides are secreted from cells by two principally different processes. In the mammary gland, lipid droplets interact with specific regions of the plasma membrane and bud off with an envelope consisting of the membrane, to form milk globules. In the liver and intestine, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons are secreted by using the secretory pathway of the cell. Finally, we briefly review the importance of lipid droplets in the development of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Thirty microalgal strains were screened in the laboratory for their biomass productivity and lipid content. Four strains (two marine and two freshwater), selected because robust, highly productive and with a relatively high lipid content, were cultivated under nitrogen deprivation in 0.6-L bubbled tubes. Only the two marine microalgae accumulated lipid under such conditions. One of them, the eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis sp. F{\&}M-M24, which attained 60{\%} lipid content after nitrogen starvation, was grown in a 20-L Flat Alveolar Panel photobioreactor to study the influence of irradiance and nutrient (nitrogen or phosphorus) deprivation on fatty acid accumulation. Fatty acid content increased with high irradiances (up to 32.5{\%} of dry biomass) and following both nitrogen and phosphorus deprivation (up to about 50{\%}). To evaluate its lipid production potential under natural sunlight, the strain was grown outdoors in 110-L Green Wall Panel photobioreactors under nutrient sufficient and deficient conditions. Lipid productivity increased from 117 mg/L/day in nutrient sufficient media (with an average biomass productivity of 0.36 g/L/day and 32{\%} lipid content) to 204 mg/L/day (with an average biomass productivity of 0.30 g/L/day and more than 60{\%} final lipid content) in nitrogen deprived media. In a two-phase cultivation process (a nutrient sufficient phase to produce the inoculum followed by a nitrogen deprived phase to boost lipid synthesis) the oil production potential could be projected to be more than 90 kg per hectare per day. This is the first report of an increase of both lipid content and areal lipid productivity attained through nutrient deprivation in an outdoor algal culture. The experiments showed that this marine eustigmatophyte has the potential for an annual production of 20 tons of lipid per hectare in the Mediterranean climate and of more than 30 tons of lipid per hectare in sunny tropical areas.},

abstract = {When the unicellular green soil alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is deprived of nitrogen after entering stationary phase in liquid culture, the cells produce abundant cytoplasmic lipid bodies (LBs), as well as abundant starch, via a pathway that accompanies a regulated autophagy program. After 48 h of N starvation in the presence of acetate, the wild-type LB content has increased 15-fold. When starch biosynthesis is blocked in the sta6 mutant, the LB content increases 30-fold, demonstrating that genetic manipulation can enhance LB production. The use of cell wall-less strains permitted development of a rapid "popped-cell" microscopic assay to quantitate the LB content per cell and permitted gentle cell breakage and LB isolation. The highly purified LBs contain 90{\%} triacylglycerol (TAG) and 10{\%} free fatty acids (FFA). The fatty acids associated with the TAGs are approximately 50{\%} saturated (C(16) and C(18)) fatty acids and approximately 50{\%} unsaturated fatty acids, half of which are in the form of oleic acid (C(18:1)). The FFA are approximately 50{\%} C(16) and approximately 50{\%} C(18). The LB-derived TAG yield from a liter of sta6 cells at 10(7) cells/ml after starvation for 48 h is calculated to approach 400 mg. The LB fraction also contains low levels of charged glycerolipids, with the same profile as whole-cell charged glycerolipids, that presumably form LB membranes; chloroplast-specific neutral glycerolipids (galactolipids) are absent. Very low levels of protein are also present, but all matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-identified species are apparent contaminants. Nitrogen stress-induced LB production in C. reinhardtii has the hallmarks of a discrete pathway that should be amenable to additional genetic and culture condition manipulation.},

This has led to the discovery of new compounds, including major membrane components, as well as the elucidation of lipid signalling pathways. A major drive in recent research have been attempts to discover genes that code for expression of the various proteins involved in the production of very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. Such work is described here together with information about how environmental factors, such as light, temperature or minerals, can change algal lipid metabolism and how adaptation may take place.},

abstract = {Biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters), which is derived from triglycerides by transesterification with methanol, has attracted considerable attention during the past decade as a renewable, biodegradable, and nontoxic fuel. Several processes for biodiesel fuel production have been developed, among which transesterification using alkali-catalysis gives high levels of conversion of triglycerides to their corresponding methyl esters in short reaction times. This process has therefore been widely utilized for biodiesel fuel production in a number of countries. Recently, enzymatic transesterification using lipase has become more attractive for biodiesel fuel production, since the glycerol produced as a by-product can easily be recovered and the purification of fatty methyl esters is simple to accomplish. The main hurdle to the commercialization of this system is the cost of lipase production. As a means of reducing the cost, the use of whole cell biocatalysts immobilized within biomass support particles is significantly advantageous since immobilization can be achieved spontaneously during batch cultivation, and in addition, no purification is necessary. The lipase production cost can be further lowered using genetic engineering technology, such as by developing lipases with high levels of expression and/or stability towards methanol. Hence, whole cell biocatalysts appear to have great potential for industrial application.},

abstract = {A low expense process is developed for recovering esterified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from microalgae and fish oil. Over 70{\%} of the EPA content in the esterified crude extract of microalgae were recovered at purities exceeding 90{\%}. The recovery scheme utilizes either wet or freeze-dried algal biomass. The process consists of only three main steps: 1) simultaneous extraction and transesterification of the algal biomass; 2) argentated silica gel column chromatography of the crude extract; and 3) removal of pigments by a second column chromatographic step. Argentated silica gel chromatography recovered about 70{\%} of the EPA ester present in the crude fatty ester mixture of fish oil, but at a reduced purity approximately 83{\%} pure) compared to the microalgal derived EPA. The optimal loading of the fatty ester mixture on the chromatographic support was about 3{\%} (w/w) but loadings up to 4{\%} did not affect the resolution significantly. The process was scaled up by a factor of nearly 320 by increasing the diameter of the chromatography columns. The elution velocity remained constant. Compared to the green alga Monodus subterraneus, the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum had important advantages as a potential commercial producer of EPA. For a microalgal EPA process to be competitive with fish oil derived EPA, P. tricornutum biomass (2.5{\%} w/w EPA) needs to be obtained at less than {\$}4/kg. If the EPA content in the alga are increased to 3.5{\%}, the biomass may command a somewhat higher price. The quality of microalgal EPA compares favorably with that of the fish oil product. Compared to free fatty acid, EPA ester is more stable in storage. Shelf-life is extended by storing in hexane. The silver contamination in the final purified EPA was negligibly small ({\textless}210 ppb).},
