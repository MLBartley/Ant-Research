abstract = {Characterization of multivariate time series of behaviour data from animal-borne sensors is challenging. Biologists require methods to objectively quantify baseline behaviour, then assess behaviour changes in response to environmental stimuli. Here, we apply hidden Markov models (HMMs) to characterize blue whale movement and diving behaviour, identifying latent states corresponding to three main underlying behaviour states: shallow feeding, travelling, and deep feeding. The model formulation accounts for inter-whale differences via a computationally efficient discrete random effect, and measures potential effects of experimental acoustic disturbance on between-state transition probabilities. We identify clear differences in blue whale disturbance response depending on the behavioural context during exposure, with whales less likely to initiate deep foraging behaviour during exposure. Findings are consistent with earlier studies using smaller samples, but the HMM approach provides more nuanced characterization of behaviour changes.},

@article{Hart2010,
abstract = {Recording the activity of animals as they migrate or forage has proven hugely advantageous to understanding how animals use their environment. Where animals cannot be directly observed, the problem remains of how to identify distinct behaviours that represent an animal's decision-making process. An excellent example of this problem is that of foraging penguins, which travel to sea to find prey to provision their young. Without direct sampling of the prey field, we cannot calibrate patterns of movement with prey capture, and therefore we cannot determine how different activities link to decision-making. To overcome this, we use a hidden markov model (HMM), which is a machine-learning technique that seeks to identify the underlying states of a system from observable outputs. We apply HMM to determine classes of behaviour from repetitive dives. We take dive data from 103 breeding macaroni penguins at Bird Island, South Georgia, for which we have measures of weight gain over a trip. We identify two classes of behaviour; those of short-shallow and long-deep dives. Using these two behaviours, we calculate the transition probabilities between these states and analyse these data to determine what predicts variation in the transition probabilities. We found that the stage of reproduction during a season, the sex and year of an individual influenced the probability of transition between long-deep and short-shallow sequential dives. We also found differences in the hourly transition rates between the four reproductive stages (incubation, broodguard, crSche and premoult) over a daily cycle. We conclude that this application of HMMs for behavioural switching is potentially useful for other species and other types of recorded behaviour.},

abstract = {Analysing behavioural sequences and quantifying the likelihood of occurrences of different behaviours is a difficult task as motivational states are not observable. Furthermore, it is ecologically highly relevant and yet more complicated to scale an appropriate model for one individual up to the population level. In this manuscript (mixed) hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to model the feeding behaviour of 54 subadult grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), small nocturnal primates endemic to Madagascar that forage solitarily. Our primary aim is to introduce ecologists and other users to various HMM methods, many of which have been developed only recently, and which in this form have not previously been synthesized in the ecological literature. Our specific application of mixed HMMs aims at gaining a better understanding of mouse lemur behaviour, in particular concerning sex-specific differences. The model we consider incorporates random effects for accommodating heterogeneity across animals, i.e. accounts for different personalities of the animals. Additional subject- and time-specific covariates in the model describe the influence of sex, body mass and time of night.},

@article{VanDyk2001,
abstract = {The term data augmentation refers to methods for constructing iterative optimization or sampling algorithms via the introduction of unobserved data or latent variables. For deterministic algorithms, the method was popularized in the general statistical community by the seminal article by Dempster, Laird, and Rubin on the EM algorithm for maximizing a likelihood function or, more generally, a posterior density. For stochastic algorithms, the method was popularized in the statistical literature by Tanner and Wong's Data Augmentation algorithm for posterior sampling and in the physics literature by Swendsen and Wang's algorithm for sampling from the Ising and Potts models and their generalizations; in the physics literature, the method of data augmentation is referred to as the method of auxiliary variables. Data augmentation schemes were used by Tanner and Wong to make simulation feasible and simple, while auxiliary variables were adopted by Swendsen and Wang to improve the speed of iterative simulation. In general, however, constructing data augmentation schemes that result in both simple and fast algorithms is a matter of art in that successful strategies vary greatly with the (observed-data) models being considered. After an overview of data augmentation/auxiliary variables and some recent developments in methods for constructing such efficient data augmentation schemes, we introduce an effective search strategy that combines the ideas of marginal augmentation and conditional augmentation, together with a deterministic approximation method for selecting good augmentation schemes. We then apply this strategy to three common classes of models (specifically, multivariate t, probit regression, and mixed-effects models) to obtain efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior sampling. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the resulting algorithms, while requiring similar programming effort, can show dramatic improvement over the Gibbs samplers commonly used for these models in practice. A key feature of all these new algorithms is that they are positive recurrent subchains of nonpositive recurrent Markov chains constructed in larger spaces.},

@article{Richardson2017,
abstract = {Rhythmical activity patterns are ubiquitous in nature. We study an
oscillatory biological system: collective activity cycles in ant
colonies. Ant colonies have become model systems for research on
biological networks because the interactions between the component parts
are visible to the naked eye, and because the time-ordered contact
network formed by these interactions serves as the substrate for the
distribution of information and other resources throughout the colony.
To understand how the collective activity cycles influence the contact
network transport properties, we used an automated tracking system to
record the movement of all the individuals within nine different ant
colonies. From these trajectories we extracted over two million
ant-to-ant interactions. Time-series analysis of the temporal
fluctuations of the overall colony interaction and movement rates
revealed that both the period and amplitude of the activity cycles
exhibit a diurnal cycle, in which daytime cycles are faster and of
greater amplitude than night cycles. Using epidemiology-derived models
of transmission over networks, we compared the transmission properties
of the observed periodic contact networks with those of synthetic
aperiodic networks. These simulations revealed that contrary to some
predictions, regularly-oscillating contact networks should impede
information transmission. Further, we provide a mechanistic explanation
for this effect, and present evidence in support of it.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of speaker diarization, the problem of segmenting an audio recording of a meeting into temporal segments corresponding to individual speakers. The problem is rendered particularly difficult by the fact that we are not allowed to assume knowledge of the number of people participating in the meeting. To address this problem, we take a Bayesian nonparametric approach to speaker diarization that builds on the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) of Teh et al. [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006) 1566--1581]. Although the basic HDP-HMM tends to over-segment the audio data---creating redundant states and rapidly switching among them---we describe an augmented HDP-HMM that provides effective control over the switching rate. We also show that this augmentation makes it possible to treat emission distributions nonparametrically. To scale the resulting architecture to realistic diarization problems, we develop a sampling algorithm that employs a truncated approximation of the Dirichlet process to jointly resample the full state sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Working with a benchmark NIST data set, we show that our Bayesian nonparametric architecture yields state-of-the-art speaker diarization results.},

@article{Snijders2005,
abstract = {This chapter treats statistical methods for network evolution. It is argued that it is most fruitful to consider models where network evolution is represented as the result of many (usually non-observed) small changes occurring between the consecutively observed networks. Accordingly, the focus is on models where a continuous-time network evolution is assumed although the observations are made at discrete time points (two or more). Three models are considered in detail, all based on the assumption that the observed networks are outcomes of a Markov process evolving in continuous time. The independent arcs model is a trivial baseline model. The reciprocity model expresses e ects of reciprocity, but lacks other structural e ects. The actor-oriented model is based on a model of actors changing their outgoing ties as a consequence of myopic stochastic optimization of an objective function. This framework o ers the exibility to represent a variety of network e ects. An estimation algorithm is treated, based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of the method of moments.},

abstract = {We consider problems involving groups of data where each observation within a group is a draw from a mixture model and where it is desirable to share mixture components between groups. We assume that the number of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the “Chinese restaurant franchise.” We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling.},

abstract = {A parametric, continuous-time Markov model for digraph panel data is considered. The parameter is estimated by the method of moments. A convenient method for estimating the variance-covariance matrix of the moment estimator relies on the delta method, requiring the Jacobian matrix-that is, the matrix of partial derivatives-of the estimating function. The Jacobian matrix was estimated hitherto by Monte Carlo methods based on finite differences. Three new Monte Carlo estimators of the Jacobian matrix are proposed, which are related to the likelihood ratio/score function method of derivative estimation and have theoretical and practical advantages compared to the finite differences method. Some light is shed on the practical performance of the methods by applying them in a situation where the true Jacobian matrix is known and in a situation where the true Jacobian matrix is unknown. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Advances in field techniques have lead to an increase in spatially-referenced capture-recapture data to estimate a species' population size as well as other demographic parameters and patterns of space usage. Statistical models for these data have assumed that the number of individuals in the population and their spatial locations follow a homogeneous Poisson point process model, which implies that the individuals are uniformly and independently distributed over the spatial domain of interest. In many applications there is reason to question independence, for example when species display territorial behavior. In this paper, we propose a new statistical model which allows for dependence between locations to account for avoidance or territorial behavior. We show via a simulation study that accounting for this can improve population size estimates. The method is illustrated using a case study of small mammal trapping data to estimate avoidance and population density of adult female field voles (Microtus agrestis) in northern England.},

The reasons this method has become so popular are the inherent statistical (mathematically precise) framework: the ease and availability of training algorithms for es- timating the parameters of the models from finite training sets of speech data; the flexibility of the resulting recognition system in which one can easily change the size, type, or architecture of the models to suit particular words, sounds. and so forth; and the ease of implementation of the overall recognition system. In this expository article, we address the role of statistical methods in this powerful technology as applied to speech recognition and discuss a range of theoretical and practical issues that are as yet unsolved in terms of their importance and their effect on performance for different system implementations.},

abstract = {Stochastic actor-based models are models for network dynamics that can represent a wide variety of influences on network change, and allow to estimate parameters expressing such influences, and test corresponding hypotheses. The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process 'driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes ('actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes ('dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior. This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for model selection. Crown Copyright ?? 2009.},

abstract = {Ants live in organized societies with a marked division of labor among workers, but little is known about how this division of labor is generated. We used a tracking system to continuously monitor individually tagged workers in six colonies of the ant Camponotus fellah over 41 days. Network analyses of more than 9 million interactions revealed three distinct groups that differ in behavioral repertoires. Each group represents a functional behavioral unit with workers moving from one group to the next as they age. The rate of interactions was much higher within groups than between groups. The precise information on spatial and temporal distribution of all individuals allowed us to calculate the expected rates of within- and between-group interactions. These values suggest that the network of interaction within colonies is primarily mediated by age-induced changes in the spatial location of workers.},

In particular, we demonstrate why well-established formal procedures for model selection, such as those based on standard information criteria, tend to favor models with numbers of states that are undesirably large in situations where states shall be meaningful entities. We also offer a pragmatic step-by-step approach together with comprehensive advice for how practitioners can implement order selection.

abstract = {Use of accelerometers is now widespread within animal biotelemetry as they provide a means of measuring an animal's activity in a meaningful and quantitative way where direct observation is not possible. In sequential acceleration data there is a natural dependence between observations of movement or behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most analyses. Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been explicitly modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Depending on the aim of an analysis, either a supervised or an unsupervised learning approach can be applied. Under a supervised context, an HMM is trained to classify unlabelled acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories, whereas we will demonstrate how an unsupervised learning approach can be used to infer new aspects of animal behaviour. We will provide the details necessary to implement and assess an HMM in both the supervised and unsupervised context, and discuss the data requirements of each case. We outline two applications to marine and aerial systems (sharks and eagles) taking the unsupervised approach, which is more readily applicable to animal activity measured in the field. HMMs were used to infer the effects of temporal, atmospheric and tidal inputs on animal behaviour. Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify important correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence behaviour). The HMM framework is well suited to deal with the main features commonly observed in accelerometer data. The ability to combine direct observations of animals activity and combine it with statistical models which account for the features of accelerometer data offer a new way to quantify animal behaviour, energetic expenditure and deepen our insights into individual behaviour as a constituent of populations and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Social networks mediate the spread of information and disease. The dynamics of spreading depends, among other factors, on the distribution of times between successive contacts in the network. Heavy-tailed (bursty) time distributions are characteristic of human communication networks, including face-to-face contacts and elec-tronic communication via mobile phone calls, email, and internet communities. Burstiness has been cited as a possible cause for slow spreading in these networks relative to a randomized reference net-work. However, it is not known whether burstiness is an epiphenom-enon of human-specific patterns of communication. Moreover, theory predicts that fast, bursty communication networks should also exist. Here, we present a high-throughput technology for automated monitoring of social interactions of individual honeybees and the analysis of a rich and detailed dataset consisting of more than 1.2 million interactions in five honeybee colonies. We find that bees, like humans, also interact in bursts but that spreading is significantly faster than in a randomized reference network and remains so even after an experimental demographic perturbation. Thus, while bursti-ness may be an intrinsic property of social interactions, it does not always inhibit spreading in real-world communication networks. We anticipate that these results will inform future models of large-scale social organization and information and disease transmission, and may impact health management of threatened honeybee populations. trophallaxis | temporal network | burstiness | barcode | tracking S ocial life depends on intricate networks of interactions among conspecifics. This is especially true for highly social animals, such as humans and eusocial insects, who use these interactions to coordinate their activities (1, 2). Network science has provided a wealth of insights about how interaction patterns impact coordination, information exchange, and disease trans-mission in animal societies (e.g., refs. 3 and 4). Recently, this knowledge has been further enhanced by the use of temporal network models, which, in addition to representing individuals and their social connections, also record when the connections between individuals are active (5, 6). Temporal networks thus acknowledge that the connection between linked individuals is only available while these individuals interact and crucially account for the temporal ordering of interactions, making them particularly relevant for models of disease and information spreading (5, 6). Spreading simulations are a powerful approach to quantifying how well an empirical temporal network supports transmission processes. Instead of tracking a particular piece of information or disease, such simulations probe the structure of the observed network and, by comparison against a randomized reference model, provide insight into how spreading dynamics reflect social interactions (5). For example, analysis of susceptible-infected (SI) spreading simulations on networks of face-to-face contacts, mobile phone calls, email, and internet communities revealed that in these networks spreading is slower than expected (5–10), suggesting that they are not optimized for fast information or disease transmission. The speed of spreading on a social network depends on the in-terplay of a variety of factors, such as its topology and the timing of successive contacts (5, 8). Human communication networks are characterized by an intermittent, unpredictable timing of interac-tions, with time intervals between successive social contacts de-scribed by a heavy-tailed distribution (burstiness) (8–11). Network theory predicts that the interplay of burstiness and other network properties could accelerate spreading (12–14). However, no fast and bursty human communication networks have been reported, and in other animal societies there are very few studies of tempo-rally highly resolved communication networks that were conducted over long enough timescales to be able to explore the relationship between burstiness and spreading dynamics (15, 16). We studied burstiness and spreading dynamics in the honeybee (Apis mellifera), a highly accessible and easily manipulated model system for social behavior and communication. Honeybees form large societies with tens of thousands of individuals, coordinated},

abstract = {Contact patterns among hosts are considered as one of the most critical factors contributing to unequal pathogen transmission. Consequently, networks have been widely applied in infectious disease modeling. However most studies assume static network structure due to lack of accurate observation and appropriate analytic tools. In this study we used high temporal and spatial resolution animal position data to construct a high-resolution contact network relevant to infectious disease transmission. The animal contact network aggregated at hourly level was highly variable and dynamic within and between days, for both network structure (network degree distribution) and individual rank of degree distribution in the network (degree order). We integrated network degree distribution and degree order heterogeneities with a commonly used contact-based, directly transmitted disease model to quantify the effect of these two sources of heterogeneity on the infectious disease dynamics. Four conditions were simulated based on the combination of these two heterogeneities. Simulation results indicated that disease dynamics and individual contribution to new infections varied substantially among these four conditions under both parameter settings. Changes in the contact network had a greater effect on disease dynamics for pathogens with smaller basic reproduction number (i.e. R0 {\textless} 2).},
