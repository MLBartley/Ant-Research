abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial freshwater and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in "established use." Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

abstract = {A hidden Markov model (HMM) with a special structure that captures the 'semi'-property of hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) is considered. The proposed model allows arbitrary dwell-time distributions in the states of the Markov chain. For dwell-time distributions with finite support the HMM formulation is exact while for those that have infinite support, e.g. the Poisson, the distribution can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy. A benefit of using theHMMformulation is that it is easy to incorporate covariates, trend and seasonal variation particularly in the hidden component of the model. In addition, the formulae and methods for forecasting, state prediction, decoding and model checking that exist for ordinary HMMs are applicable to the proposed class of models. An HMM with explicitly modeled dwell-time distributions involving seasonality is used to model daily rainfall occurrence for sites in Bulgaria. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The relationships between areal (g m(-2) per day) and volumetric (g l(-1) per day) productivity of Nannochloropsis sp. as affected by the light-path (ranging from 1.3 to 17.0 cm) of a vertical flat plate glass photobioreactor were elucidated. In general, the shorter the length of the light-path (LP), the smaller the areal volume and the higher the volumetric productivity. The areal productivity in relation to the light-path, in contrast, yielded an optimum curve, the highest areal productivity was obtained in a 10 cm LP reactor, which is regarded, therefore, optimal for mass production of Nannochloropsis. An attempt was made to identify criteria by which to assess the efficiency of a photobioreactor in utilizing strong incident energy. Two basic factors which relate to reactor efficiency and its cost-effectiveness have been defined as (a) the total illuminated surface required to produce a set quantity of product and (b) culture volume required to produce that quantity. As a general guide line, the lower these values are, the more efficient and cost-effective the reactor would be. An interesting feature of this analysis rests with the fact that an open raceways is as effective in productivity per illuminated area as a flat-plate reactor with an optimal light path, both cultivation systems requiring ca. 85 m(2) of illuminated surface to produce 1 kg dry cell mass of Nannochloropsis sp. per day. The difference in light utilization efficiency between the two very different production systems involves three aspects - first, the open raceway requires ca. 6 times greater volume than the 10 cm flat plate reactor to produce the same quantity of cell-mass. Second, the total ground area (i.e. including the ground area between reactors) for the vertical flat plate reactor is less than one half of that occupied by an open raceway, indicating the former is more efficient, photosynthetically, compared with the latter. Finally, the harvested cell density is close to one order of magnitude higher in the flat plate reactor, which carries economic significance. The advantage of vertical lamination of photoautotrophic cells provided by vertical plate reactors, is thereby clearly seen. The optimal population density (i.e. which results in the highest areal productivity) in the 10 cm plate reactor was obtained by a daily harvest of 10{\%} of culture volume, yielding an annual average of ca. 12.1 g dry wt. m(-2) per day (on the basis of the overall illuminated reactor surfaces, i.e. front and back) or 240 mg l(-1) per day.},

abstract = {Neutral lipids are stored in the cytosol in so-called lipid droplets. These are dynamic organelles with neutral lipids as the core surrounded by a monolayer of amphipathic lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol) and specific proteins (PAT proteins and proteins involved in the turnover of lipids and in the formation and trafficking of the droplets). Lipid droplets are formed at microsomal membranes as primordial droplets with a diameter of 0.1-0.4 microm and increase in size by fusion. In this article, we review the assembly and fusion of lipid droplets, and the processes involved in the secretion of triglycerides. Triglycerides are secreted from cells by two principally different processes. In the mammary gland, lipid droplets interact with specific regions of the plasma membrane and bud off with an envelope consisting of the membrane, to form milk globules. In the liver and intestine, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons are secreted by using the secretory pathway of the cell. Finally, we briefly review the importance of lipid droplets in the development of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Recording the activity of animals as they migrate or forage has proven hugely advantageous to understanding how animals use their environment. Where animals cannot be directly observed, the problem remains of how to identify distinct behaviours that represent an animal's decision-making process. An excellent example of this problem is that of foraging penguins, which travel to sea to find prey to provision their young. Without direct sampling of the prey field, we cannot calibrate patterns of movement with prey capture, and therefore we cannot determine how different activities link to decision-making. To overcome this, we use a hidden markov model (HMM), which is a machine-learning technique that seeks to identify the underlying states of a system from observable outputs. We apply HMM to determine classes of behaviour from repetitive dives. We take dive data from 103 breeding macaroni penguins at Bird Island, South Georgia, for which we have measures of weight gain over a trip. We identify two classes of behaviour; those of short-shallow and long-deep dives. Using these two behaviours, we calculate the transition probabilities between these states and analyse these data to determine what predicts variation in the transition probabilities. We found that the stage of reproduction during a season, the sex and year of an individual influenced the probability of transition between long-deep and short-shallow sequential dives. We also found differences in the hourly transition rates between the four reproductive stages (incubation, broodguard, crSche and premoult) over a daily cycle. We conclude that this application of HMMs for behavioural switching is potentially useful for other species and other types of recorded behaviour.},

abstract = {Lake depth is an important characteristic for understanding many lake processes, yet it is unknown for the vast majority of lakes globally. Our objective was to develop a model that predicts lake depth using map-derived metrics of lake and terrestrial geomorphic features. Building on previous models that use local topography to predict lake depth, we hypothesized that regional differences in topography, lake shape, or sedimentation processes could lead to region-specific relationships between lake depth and the mapped features. We therefore used a mixed modeling approach that included region-specific model parameters. We built models using lake and map data from LAGOS, which includes 8164 lakes with maximum depth (Z(max)) observations. The model was used to predict depth for all lakes {\textgreater}= 4 ha (n = 42 443) in the study extent. Lake surface area and maximum slope in a 100 m buffer were the best predictors of Z(max). Interactions between surface area and topography occurred at both the local and regional scale; surface area had a larger effect in steep terrain, so large lakes embedded in steep terrain were much deeper than those in flat terrain. Despite a large sample size and inclusion of regional variability, model performance (R-2 = 0.29, RMSE = 7.1 m) was similar to other published models. The relative error varied by region, however, highlighting the importance of taking a regional approach to lake depth modeling. Additionally, we provide the largest known collection of observed and predicted lake depth values in the United States.},

abstract = {Advances in field techniques have lead to an increase in spatially-referenced capture-recapture data to estimate a species' population size as well as other demographic parameters and patterns of space usage. Statistical models for these data have assumed that the number of individuals in the population and their spatial locations follow a homogeneous Poisson point process model, which implies that the individuals are uniformly and independently distributed over the spatial domain of interest. In many applications there is reason to question independence, for example when species display territorial behavior. In this paper, we propose a new statistical model which allows for dependence between locations to account for avoidance or territorial behavior. We show via a simulation study that accounting for this can improve population size estimates. The method is illustrated using a case study of small mammal trapping data to estimate avoidance and population density of adult female field voles (Microtus agrestis) in northern England.},

Renewable, carbon neutral, transport fuels are necessary for environmental and economic sustainability. Biodiesel derived from oil crops is a potential renewable and carbon neutral alternative to petroleum fuels. Unfortunately, biodiesel from oil crops, waste cooking oil and animal fat cannot realistically satisfy even a small fraction of the existing demand for transport fuels. As demonstrated here, microalgae appear to be the only source of renewable biodiesel that is capable of meeting the global demand for transport fuels. Like plants, microalgae use sunlight to produce oils but they do so more efficiently than crop plants. Oil productivity of many microalgae greatly exceeds the oil productivity of the best producing oil crops. Approaches for making microalgal biodiesel economically competitive with petrodiesel are discussed.},

Consequently, networks have been widely applied in infectious disease modeling. However most studies assume static network structure due to lack of accurate observation and appropriate analytic tools. In this study we used high temporal and spatial resolution animal position data to construct a high-resolution contact network relevant to infectious disease transmission. The animal contact network aggregated at hourly level was highly variable and dynamic within and between days, for both network structure (network degree distribution) and individual rank of degree distribution in the network (degree order). We integrated network degree distribution and degree order heterogeneities with a commonly used contact-based, directly transmitted disease model to quantify the effect of these two sources of heterogeneity on the infectious disease dynamics. Four conditions were simulated based on the combination of these two heterogeneities. Simulation results indicated that disease dynamics and individual contribution to new infections varied substantially among these four conditions under both parameter settings. Changes in the contact network had a greater effect on disease dynamics for pathogens with smaller basic reproduction number (i.e. R0 {\textless} 2).},

abstract = {Diving behaviour of short-finned pilot whales is often described by two states; deep foraging and shallow, non-foraging dives. However, this simple classification system ignores much of the variation that occurs during subsurface periods. We used multi-state hidden Markov models (HMM) to characterize states of diving behaviour and the transitions between states in short-finned pilot whales. We used three parameters (number of buzzes, maximum dive depth and duration) measured in 259 dives by digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) deployed on 20 individual whales off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, USA. The HMM identified a four-state model as the best descriptor of diving behaviour. The state-dependent distributions for the diving parameters showed variation between states, indicative of different diving behaviours. Transition probabilities were considerably higher for state persistence than state switching, indicating that dive types occurred in bouts. Our results indicate that subsurface behaviour in short-finned pilot whales is more complex than a simple dichotomy of deep and shallow diving states, and labelling all subsurface behaviour as deep dives or shallow dives discounts a significant amount of important variation. We discuss potential drivers of these patterns, including variation in foraging success, prey availability and selection, bathymetry, physiological constraints and socially mediated behaviour.},

Evolution of range limits is understudied in natural systems; in particular, the role of gene flow in shaping range limits is unknown.

abstract = {Sustainability is a key principle in natural resource management, and it involves operational efficiency, minimisation of environmental impact and socio-economic considerations; all of which are interdependent. It has become increasingly obvious that continued reliance on fossil fuel energy resources is unsustainable, owing to both depleting world reserves and the green house gas emissions associated with their use. Therefore, there are vigorous research initiatives aimed at developing alternative renewable and potentially carbon neutral solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels as alternative energy resources. However, alternate energy resources akin to first generation biofuels derived from terrestrial crops such as sugarcane, sugar beet, maize and rapeseed place an enormous strain on world food markets, contribute to water shortages and precipitate the destruction of the world's forests. Second generation biofuels derived from lignocellulosic agriculture and forest residues and from non-food crop feedstocks address some of the above problems; however there is concern over competing land use or required land use changes. Therefore, based on current knowledge and technology projections, third generation biofuels specifically derived from microalgae are considered to be a technically viable alternative energy resource that is devoid of the major drawbacks associated with first and second generation biofuels. Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms with simple growing requirements (light, sugars, CO2, N, P, and K) that can produce lipids, proteins and carbohydrates in large amounts over short periods of time. These products can be processed into both biofuels and valuable co-products. This study reviewed the technologies underpinning microalgae-to-biofuels systems, focusing on the biomass production, harvesting, conversion technologies, and the extraction of useful co-products. It also reviewed the synergistic coupling of microalgae propagation with carbon sequestration and wastewater treatment potential for mitigation of environmental impacts associated with energy conversion and utilisation. It was found that, whereas there are outstanding issues related to photosynthetic efficiencies and biomass output, microalgae-derived biofuels could progressively substitute a significant proportion of the fossil fuels required to meet the growing energy demand.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of speaker diarization, the problem of segmenting an audio recording of a meeting into temporal segments corresponding to individual speakers. The problem is rendered particularly difficult by the fact that we are not allowed to assume knowledge of the number of people participating in the meeting. To address this problem, we take a Bayesian nonparametric approach to speaker diarization that builds on the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) of Teh et al. [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006) 1566--1581]. Although the basic HDP-HMM tends to over-segment the audio data---creating redundant states and rapidly switching among them---we describe an augmented HDP-HMM that provides effective control over the switching rate. We also show that this augmentation makes it possible to treat emission distributions nonparametrically. To scale the resulting architecture to realistic diarization problems, we develop a sampling algorithm that employs a truncated approximation of the Dirichlet process to jointly resample the full state sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Working with a benchmark NIST data set, we show that our Bayesian nonparametric architecture yields state-of-the-art speaker diarization results.},

@article{Patterson2009,
abstract = {1.  Linking the movement and behaviour of animals to their environment is a central problem in ecology. Through the use of electronic tagging and tracking (ETT), collection of in situ data from free-roaming animals is now commonplace, yet statistical approaches enabling direct relation of movement observations to environmental conditions are still in development.  2.  In this study, we examine the hidden Markov model (HMM) for behavioural analysis of tracking data. HMMs allow for prediction of latent behavioural states while directly accounting for the serial dependence prevalent in ETT data. Updating the probability of behavioural switches with tag or remote-sensing data provides a statistical method that links environmental data to behaviour in a direct and integrated manner.  3.  It is important to assess the reliability of state categorization over the range of time-series lengths typically collected from field instruments and when movement behaviours are similar between movement states. Simulation with varying lengths of times series data and contrast between average movements within each state was used to test the HMMs ability to estimate movement parameters.  4.  To demonstrate the methods in a realistic setting, the HMMs were used to categorize resident and migratory phases and the relationship between movement behaviour and ocean temperature using electronic tagging data from southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii). Diagnostic tools to evaluate the suitability of different models and inferential methods for investigating differences in behaviour between individuals are also demonstrated.},

abstract = {Biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters), which is derived from triglycerides by transesterification with methanol, has attracted considerable attention during the past decade as a renewable, biodegradable, and nontoxic fuel. Several processes for biodiesel fuel production have been developed, among which transesterification using alkali-catalysis gives high levels of conversion of triglycerides to their corresponding methyl esters in short reaction times. This process has therefore been widely utilized for biodiesel fuel production in a number of countries. Recently, enzymatic transesterification using lipase has become more attractive for biodiesel fuel production, since the glycerol produced as a by-product can easily be recovered and the purification of fatty methyl esters is simple to accomplish. The main hurdle to the commercialization of this system is the cost of lipase production. As a means of reducing the cost, the use of whole cell biocatalysts immobilized within biomass support particles is significantly advantageous since immobilization can be achieved spontaneously during batch cultivation, and in addition, no purification is necessary. The lipase production cost can be further lowered using genetic engineering technology, such as by developing lipases with high levels of expression and/or stability towards methanol. Hence, whole cell biocatalysts appear to have great potential for industrial application.},

abstract = {Characterization of multivariate time series of behaviour data from animal-borne sensors is challenging. Biologists require methods to objectively quantify baseline behaviour, then assess behaviour changes in response to environmental stimuli. Here, we apply hidden Markov models (HMMs) to characterize blue whale movement and diving behaviour, identifying latent states corresponding to three main underlying behaviour states: shallow feeding, travelling, and deep feeding. The model formulation accounts for inter-whale differences via a computationally efficient discrete random effect, and measures potential effects of experimental acoustic disturbance on between-state transition probabilities. We identify clear differences in blue whale disturbance response depending on the behavioural context during exposure, with whales less likely to initiate deep foraging behaviour during exposure. Findings are consistent with earlier studies using smaller samples, but the HMM approach provides more nuanced characterization of behaviour changes.},

abstract = {Diving behaviour of short-finned pilot whales is often described by two states; deep foraging and shallow, non-foraging dives. However, this simple classification system ignores much of the variation that occurs during subsurface periods. We used multi-state hidden Markov models (HMM) to characterize states of diving behaviour and the transitions between states in short-finned pilot whales. We used three parameters (number of buzzes, maximum dive depth and duration) measured in 259 dives by digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) deployed on 20 individual whales off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, USA. The HMM identified a four-state model as the best descriptor of diving behaviour. The state-dependent distributions for the diving parameters showed variation between states, indicative of different diving behaviours. Transition probabilities were considerably higher for state persistence than state switching, indicating that dive types occurred in bouts. Our results indicate that subsurface behaviour in short-finned pilot whales is more complex than a simple dichotomy of deep and shallow diving states, and labelling all subsurface behaviour as deep dives or shallow dives discounts a significant amount of important variation. We discuss potential drivers of these patterns, including variation in foraging success, prey availability and selection, bathymetry, physiological constraints and socially mediated behaviour.},

abstract = {Animals must move to find food and mates, and to avoid predators; movement thus influences survival and reproduction, and ultimately determines fitness. Precise description of movement and understanding of spatial and temporal patterns as well as relationships with intrinsic and extrinsic factors is important both for theoretical and applied reasons. We applied hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM) to hourly geographic positioning system (GPS) location data to understand movement patterns of the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) and to discern factors influencing these patterns. Three distinct movement modes were identified: (1) Resting mode, characterized by short step lengths and turning angles around 180(o) ; (2) Moderately active (or intermediate) mode characterized by intermediate step lengths and variable turning angles, and (3) Traveling mode, characterized by long step lengths and turning angles around 0(o) . Males and females, and females with and without kittens, exhibited distinctly different movement patterns. Using the Viterbi algorithm, we show that differences in movement patterns of male and female Florida panthers were a consequence of sex-specific differences in diurnal patterns of state occupancy and sex-specific differences in state-specific movement parameters, whereas the differences between females with and without dependent kittens were caused solely by variation in state occupancy. Our study demonstrates the use of HSMM methodology to precisely describe movement and to dissect differences in movement patterns according to sex, and reproductive status.},

Network analyses of more than 9 million interactions revealed three distinct groups that differ in behavioral repertoires. Each group represents a functional behavioral unit with workers moving from one group to the next as they age. The rate of interactions was much higher within groups than between groups. The precise information on spatial and temporal distribution of all individuals allowed us to calculate the expected rates of within- and between-group interactions. These values suggest that the network of interaction within colonies is primarily mediated by age-induced changes in the spatial location of workers.},

In this manuscript (mixed) hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to model the feeding behaviour of 54 subadult grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), small nocturnal primates endemic to Madagascar that forage solitarily. Our primary aim is to introduce ecologists and other users to various HMM methods, many of which have been developed only recently, and which in this form have not previously been synthesized in the ecological literature. Our specific application of mixed HMMs aims at gaining a better understanding of mouse lemur behaviour, in particular concerning sex-specific differences. The model we consider incorporates random effects for accommodating heterogeneity across animals, i.e. accounts for different personalities of the animals. Additional subject- and time-specific covariates in the model describe the influence of sex, body mass and time of night.},

This is of importance in the design of oil rigs and other marine structures which must be able to withstand extreme environmental loadings. Such loadings are often functions of two or more metocean variables and the problem is to estimate the extremes of their joint distribution, typically beyond the range of the observed data. The statistical methodology involves both univariate and multivariate extreme value theory. Multivariate theory which avoids (often very inappropriate) prior assumptions about the nature of the statistical association between the variables is a fairly recent development. We review and adapt this theory, presenting simpler descriptions and proofs of the key results. We study in detail an application to data collected over a nine-year period at the Alwyn North platform in the northern North Sea. We consider the many problems arising in the analysis of such data, including those of seasonality and short-term dependence, and we show that multivariate extreme value theory may indeed be used to estimate probabilities and return periods associated with extreme events. We consider also the confidence intervals associated with such estimates and the implications for future data collection and analysis. Finally we review further both the statistical and engineering issues raised by our analysis.},

New techniques for inferring behavioral states and their relation to social and environmental factors provide a powerful way to test the influence of such factors on individuals. One such technique that has recently gained popularity is the use of hidden Markov models, which link time series of movement variables and the underlying behavioral states of individuals. We used hidden Markov models to evaluate behavioral states and their relation to environmental, seasonal, and social factors in the cooperatively breeding red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) while accounting for individual heterogeneity with discrete random effects. We identified 2 distinct behavioral states, resting and foraging, which were related to covariates in our models. Using this approach, we concluded that woodpecker step lengths tended to be longest in winter, larger groups of woodpeckers tended to spend less time foraging and more time resting when compared with smaller groups, and woodpeckers foraged more and rested less when in higher-quality habitat. Our results demonstrate the impact that social and environmental factors can have on movement in a social species and, thus, reinforce the importance of including these factors in animal movement studies. The extensions of basic hidden Markov models considered here may prove valuable in forthcoming studies that involve high-resolution tracking to understand behavior of birds and other small animals.},

abstract = {In classical machine learning, regression is treated as a black box process of identifying a suitable function from a hypothesis set without attempting to gain insight into the mechanism connecting inputs and outputs. In the natural sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the prime goal as it allows to understand and generalize results. This paper proposes a novel type of function learning network, called equation learner (EQL), that can learn analytical expressions and is able to extrapolate to unseen domains. It is implemented as an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward network and allows for efficient gradient based training. Due to sparsity regularization concise interpretable expressions can be obtained. Often the true underlying source expression is identified.},

The reasons this method has become so popular are the inherent statistical (mathematically precise) framework: the ease and availability of training algorithms for es- timating the parameters of the models from finite training sets of speech data; the flexibility of the resulting recognition system in which one can easily change the size, type, or architecture of the models to suit particular words, sounds. and so forth; and the ease of implementation of the overall recognition system. In this expository article, we address the role of statistical methods in this powerful technology as applied to speech recognition and discuss a range of theoretical and practical issues that are as yet unsolved in terms of their importance and their effect on performance for different system implementations.},

abstract = {Thirty microalgal strains were screened in the laboratory for their biomass productivity and lipid content. Four strains (two marine and two freshwater), selected because robust, highly productive and with a relatively high lipid content, were cultivated under nitrogen deprivation in 0.6-L bubbled tubes. Only the two marine microalgae accumulated lipid under such conditions. One of them, the eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis sp. F{\&}M-M24, which attained 60{\%} lipid content after nitrogen starvation, was grown in a 20-L Flat Alveolar Panel photobioreactor to study the influence of irradiance and nutrient (nitrogen or phosphorus) deprivation on fatty acid accumulation. Fatty acid content increased with high irradiances (up to 32.5{\%} of dry biomass) and following both nitrogen and phosphorus deprivation (up to about 50{\%}). To evaluate its lipid production potential under natural sunlight, the strain was grown outdoors in 110-L Green Wall Panel photobioreactors under nutrient sufficient and deficient conditions. Lipid productivity increased from 117 mg/L/day in nutrient sufficient media (with an average biomass productivity of 0.36 g/L/day and 32{\%} lipid content) to 204 mg/L/day (with an average biomass productivity of 0.30 g/L/day and more than 60{\%} final lipid content) in nitrogen deprived media. In a two-phase cultivation process (a nutrient sufficient phase to produce the inoculum followed by a nitrogen deprived phase to boost lipid synthesis) the oil production potential could be projected to be more than 90 kg per hectare per day. This is the first report of an increase of both lipid content and areal lipid productivity attained through nutrient deprivation in an outdoor algal culture. The experiments showed that this marine eustigmatophyte has the potential for an annual production of 20 tons of lipid per hectare in the Mediterranean climate and of more than 30 tons of lipid per hectare in sunny tropical areas.},

abstract = {Rhythmical activity patterns are ubiquitous in nature. We study an
oscillatory biological system: collective activity cycles in ant
colonies. Ant colonies have become model systems for research on
biological networks because the interactions between the component parts
are visible to the naked eye, and because the time-ordered contact
network formed by these interactions serves as the substrate for the
distribution of information and other resources throughout the colony.
To understand how the collective activity cycles influence the contact
network transport properties, we used an automated tracking system to
record the movement of all the individuals within nine different ant
colonies. From these trajectories we extracted over two million
ant-to-ant interactions. Time-series analysis of the temporal
fluctuations of the overall colony interaction and movement rates
revealed that both the period and amplitude of the activity cycles
exhibit a diurnal cycle, in which daytime cycles are faster and of
greater amplitude than night cycles. Using epidemiology-derived models
of transmission over networks, we compared the transmission properties
of the observed periodic contact networks with those of synthetic
aperiodic networks. These simulations revealed that contrary to some
predictions, regularly-oscillating contact networks should impede
information transmission. Further, we provide a mechanistic explanation
for this effect, and present evidence in support of it.},

abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.},

abstract = {With the influx of complex and detailed tracking data gathered from electronic tracking devices, the analysis of animal movement data has recently emerged as a cottage industry amongst biostatisticians. New approaches of ever greater complexity are continue to be added to the literature. In this paper, we review what we believe to be some of the most popular and most useful classes of statistical models used to analyze individual animal movement data. Specifically we consider discrete-time hidden Markov models, more general state-space models and diffusion processes. We argue that these models should be core components in the toolbox for quantitative researchers working on stochastic modelling of individual animal movement. The paper concludes by offering some general observations on the direction of statistical analysis of animal movement. There is a trend in movement ecology toward what are arguably overly-complex modelling approaches which are inaccessible to ecologists, unwieldy with large data sets or not based in mainstream statistical practice. Additionally, some analysis methods developed within the ecological community ignore fundamental properties of movement data, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about animal movement. Corresponding approaches, e.g. based on L$\backslash$'evy walk-type models, continue to be popular despite having been largely discredited. We contend that there is a need for an appropriate balance between the extremes of either being overly complex or being overly simplistic, whereby the discipline relies on models of intermediate complexity that are usable by general ecologists, but grounded in well-developed statistical practice and efficient to fit to large data sets.},

abstract = {Detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data is complicated by the intricate ascertainment schemes used to discover SNPs, and by the confounding influence of the underlying complex demographics and varying mutation and recombination rates. Current methods for detecting selective sweeps have little or no robustness to the demographic assumptions and varying recombination rates, and provide no method for correcting for ascertainment biases. Here, we present several new tests aimed at detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data. Using extensive simulations, we show that a new parametric test, based on composite likelihood, has a high power to detect selective sweeps and is surprisingly robust to assumptions regarding recombination rates and demography (i.e., has low Type I error). Our new test also provides estimates of the location of the selective sweep(s) and the magnitude of the selection coefficient. To illustrate the method, we apply our approach to data from the Seattle SNP project and to Chromosome 2 data from the HapMap project. In Chromosome 2, the most extreme signal is found in the lactase gene, which previously has been shown to be undergoing positive selection. Evidence for selective sweeps is also found in many other regions, including genes known to be associated with disease risk such as DPP10 and COL4A3.},

abstract = {The relationship between chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total phosphorus (TP) is a fundamental relationship in lakes that reflects multiple aspects of ecosystem function and is also used in the regulation and management of inland waters. The exact form of this relationship has substantial implications on its meaning and its use. We assembled a spatially extensive data set to examine whether nonlinear models are a better fit for Chl a TP relationships than traditional log-linear models, whether there were regional differences in the form of the relationships, and, if so, which regional factors were related to these differences. We analyzed a data set from 2105 temperate lakes across 35 ecoregions by fitting and comparing two different nonlinear models and one log-linear model. The two nonlinear models fit the data better than the log-linear model. In addition, the parameters for the best-fitting model varied among regions: the maximum and lower Chl a asymptotes were positively and negatively related to percent regional pasture land use, respectively, and the rate at which chlorophyll increased with TP was negatively related to percent regional wetland cover. Lakes in regions with more pasture fields had higher maximum chlorophyll concentrations at high TP concentrations but lower minimum chlorophyll concentrations at low TP concentrations. Lakes in regions with less wetland cover showed a steeper Chl a-TP relationship than wetland-rich regions. Interpretation of Chl a-TP relationships depends on regional differences, and theory and management based on a monolithic relationship may be inaccurate.},

A Markov chain process used to model an unobserved serially dependent process is commonly called hidden Markov model (HMM), which is used in fields as diverse as signal processing, machine learning (e.g., handwriting recognition), environmental sciences, economics, and longitudinal data in social or medical sciences. Given the importance and widespread use of HMM, several books and references have been published for students, practitioners, and researchers. Hidden Markov Models for Time Series: An Introduction Using R (2nd Edition) is a book on HMM dedicated to time series data for researchers who cannot use a standard time series model for their data, including researchers in animal behavior, epidemiology, finance, hydrology, and sociology, among others. The book is structured in three parts. Part I of the book (eight chapters), Model Structure, Properties and Methods, presents the theoretical and mathematical context for HMM. In Part II (five chapters), Extensions, the authors introduce additional complexities to the stan-dard HMM, including continuous variables, covariates, semi-Markov models, and longitudinal data. Applications of hidden Markov models are presented in eleven chapters in Part III of the book, Applications. Each chapter in the book ends with exercises on the application of HMM, proofs, data analysis, and practice writing R functions. The authors use a recurring example (earthquake counts) to aid understanding HMM. The book has two appendices that present R code and some mathematical proofs and results. A dedicated website to the book provides the R code used in the book and errata for both the first and second editions of the book. Companion data sets are provided on the book's first edition link in the dedicated website. In Chapter 1, Preliminaries: Mixtures and Markov Chains, the authors introduce independent mixture distributions and Markov chains. An example on modeling earthquakes using Poisson},

When outliers are present in the measurements, special care is needed in the analysis to obtain reliable location and process estimates. Here we recommend using the Laplace approximation combined with automatic differentiation (as implemented in the novel R-package: Template Model Builder (TMB)) for the fast fitting of continuous time multivariate non-Gaussian SSMs. Through Argos satellite tracking data, we demonstrate that the use of continuous time t-distributed measurement errors for error-prone data is more robust to outliers and improves the location estimation compared to using discretized time t-distributed errors (implemented with a Gibbs sampler) or using continuous time Gaussian errors (as with the Kalman filter). Using TMB, we are able to estimate additional parameters compared to previous methods, all without requiring a substantial increase in comp...},

A GAM is a flexible nonparametric technique that can be used to model complex relations between a response variable and independent variables. Functions are fitted between a number of breakpoints (knots) along the independent variable range, in general using cubic polynomials (or cubic splines), and these functions are then smoothly joined to form the final curve. There is no a priori assumption about the functional form of the relationship. The trade-off between fidelity to the data and smoothness of the fitted curve can be regulated automatically or manually. The curve can be automatically fitted by estimating a smoothing parameter, and thereby the number of knots and degrees of freedom (= 'number of knots' - 1), minimizing the generalized cross validation score (Wood 2000). Alternatively, the number of knots can be fixed manually.},

abstract = {When the unicellular green soil alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is deprived of nitrogen after entering stationary phase in liquid culture, the cells produce abundant cytoplasmic lipid bodies (LBs), as well as abundant starch, via a pathway that accompanies a regulated autophagy program. After 48 h of N starvation in the presence of acetate, the wild-type LB content has increased 15-fold. When starch biosynthesis is blocked in the sta6 mutant, the LB content increases 30-fold, demonstrating that genetic manipulation can enhance LB production. The use of cell wall-less strains permitted development of a rapid "popped-cell" microscopic assay to quantitate the LB content per cell and permitted gentle cell breakage and LB isolation. The highly purified LBs contain 90{\%} triacylglycerol (TAG) and 10{\%} free fatty acids (FFA). The fatty acids associated with the TAGs are approximately 50{\%} saturated (C(16) and C(18)) fatty acids and approximately 50{\%} unsaturated fatty acids, half of which are in the form of oleic acid (C(18:1)). The FFA are approximately 50{\%} C(16) and approximately 50{\%} C(18). The LB-derived TAG yield from a liter of sta6 cells at 10(7) cells/ml after starvation for 48 h is calculated to approach 400 mg. The LB fraction also contains low levels of charged glycerolipids, with the same profile as whole-cell charged glycerolipids, that presumably form LB membranes; chloroplast-specific neutral glycerolipids (galactolipids) are absent. Very low levels of protein are also present, but all matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-identified species are apparent contaminants. Nitrogen stress-induced LB production in C. reinhardtii has the hallmarks of a discrete pathway that should be amenable to additional genetic and culture condition manipulation.},

This provides a parametric method of dealing with availability bias when estimates of availability process parameters are available even if series of availability events themselves are not. We apply the estimators to an aerial and a shipboard survey of whales, and investigate their properties by simulation. They are shown to be more general and more flexible than existing estimators based on parametric models of the availability process. We also find that methods using availability correction factors can be very biased when surveys are not close to being instantaneous, as can estimators that assume temporal independence in availability when there is temporal dependence.},

Inaccuracies can occur when there is a very low degree of smoothing or "borrowing strength" within the model, and we have therefore developed a correction aiming to push the boundaries of the applicability of INLA. Our new correction has been implemented as part of the R-INLA package, and adds only negligible computational cost.

abstract = {Social organisms are especially vulnerable to pathogens due to the homogeneity of the colony, and the close proximity and extensive interactions among its members. However, the social organization of these groups also offers the potential to provide an effective barrier against the transmission of pathogens within the colony. Social insects with their elaborate colony organizations provide an ideal model system to develop and test this hypothesis. While the different elements of colony organization are generally assumed to be products of ergonomic selection, in this paper we address how the same elements could influence the transmission of pathogens. By developing a simple model, we explore how three parameters of colony organization, division of labor, interaction network and colony demography could influence the transmission of pathogens. We find that heterogeneity among individuals in terms of division of labor alone has little effect on the spread of an infection in the colony and the scenario is indistinguishable from one in which all the individuals are homogeneous. However, division of labor, combined with heterogeneity in the interaction network and demographic schedules reduce the spread of an infection. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The approaches are applied to a set of coastal marine benthic macrofaunal observations, and associated environmental data, measured at 48 sites in St Anns Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada. A multivariate generalized least-squares regression was used to establish a predictive relationship between benthic fauna and the environment. Five ecological indices derived from faunal composition (abundance, richness, species number, diversity, AMBI) were treated as a multivariate response, and 10 environmental variables as candidate predictors. The multivariate regression also incorporated the effects of spatial autocorrelation. Predictive relationships were highly significant, and variable selection identified three key environmental predictors (median sediment grain size, porosity, and sulfide). Using these baseline data, we developed a procedure to identify a reduced sampling design for long-term monitoring of benthic faunal health. The procedure is based on a sequential (backward elimination) algorithm to identify the set of sites that contributed most to the overall information. This study provides a general and comprehensive statistical framework for treating environmental monitoring and sampling design. It can be extended beyond the statistical framework used, and applied to a range of ecological applications.},

Although originally envisioned to account for differences in survival and observation processes when animals are moving though various geographical strata, the model has evolved to model vital rates in different life-history or diseased states. We further extend this useful class of models to the case of multivariate state data. Researchers can record values of several different states of interest, for example, geographic location and reproductive state. Traditionally, these would be aggregated into one state with a single probability of state uncertainty. However, by modeling states as a multivariate vector, one can account for partial knowledge of the vector as well as dependence between the state variables in a parsimonious way. A hidden Markov model (HMM) formulation allows straightforward maximum likelihood inference. The proposed HMM models are demonstrated with a case study using data from a California sea lion vital rates study.},

abstract = {Social networks mediate the spread of information and disease. The dynamics of spreading depends, among other factors, on the distribution of times between successive contacts in the network. Heavy-tailed (bursty) time distributions are characteristic of human communication networks, including face-to-face contacts and elec-tronic communication via mobile phone calls, email, and internet communities. Burstiness has been cited as a possible cause for slow spreading in these networks relative to a randomized reference net-work. However, it is not known whether burstiness is an epiphenom-enon of human-specific patterns of communication. Moreover, theory predicts that fast, bursty communication networks should also exist. Here, we present a high-throughput technology for automated monitoring of social interactions of individual honeybees and the analysis of a rich and detailed dataset consisting of more than 1.2 million interactions in five honeybee colonies. We find that bees, like humans, also interact in bursts but that spreading is significantly faster than in a randomized reference network and remains so even after an experimental demographic perturbation. Thus, while bursti-ness may be an intrinsic property of social interactions, it does not always inhibit spreading in real-world communication networks. We anticipate that these results will inform future models of large-scale social organization and information and disease transmission, and may impact health management of threatened honeybee populations. trophallaxis | temporal network | burstiness | barcode | tracking S ocial life depends on intricate networks of interactions among conspecifics. This is especially true for highly social animals, such as humans and eusocial insects, who use these interactions to coordinate their activities (1, 2). Network science has provided a wealth of insights about how interaction patterns impact coordination, information exchange, and disease trans-mission in animal societies (e.g., refs. 3 and 4). Recently, this knowledge has been further enhanced by the use of temporal network models, which, in addition to representing individuals and their social connections, also record when the connections between individuals are active (5, 6). Temporal networks thus acknowledge that the connection between linked individuals is only available while these individuals interact and crucially account for the temporal ordering of interactions, making them particularly relevant for models of disease and information spreading (5, 6). Spreading simulations are a powerful approach to quantifying how well an empirical temporal network supports transmission processes. Instead of tracking a particular piece of information or disease, such simulations probe the structure of the observed network and, by comparison against a randomized reference model, provide insight into how spreading dynamics reflect social interactions (5). For example, analysis of susceptible-infected (SI) spreading simulations on networks of face-to-face contacts, mobile phone calls, email, and internet communities revealed that in these networks spreading is slower than expected (5–10), suggesting that they are not optimized for fast information or disease transmission. The speed of spreading on a social network depends on the in-terplay of a variety of factors, such as its topology and the timing of successive contacts (5, 8). Human communication networks are characterized by an intermittent, unpredictable timing of interac-tions, with time intervals between successive social contacts de-scribed by a heavy-tailed distribution (burstiness) (8–11). Network theory predicts that the interplay of burstiness and other network properties could accelerate spreading (12–14). However, no fast and bursty human communication networks have been reported, and in other animal societies there are very few studies of tempo-rally highly resolved communication networks that were conducted over long enough timescales to be able to explore the relationship between burstiness and spreading dynamics (15, 16). We studied burstiness and spreading dynamics in the honeybee (Apis mellifera), a highly accessible and easily manipulated model system for social behavior and communication. Honeybees form large societies with tens of thousands of individuals, coordinated},

abstract = {Designs conditions for marine structures are typically informed by threshold-based extreme value analyses of oceanographic variables, in which excesses of a high threshold are modelled by a generalized Pareto (GP) distribution. Too low a threshold leads to bias from model mis-specification; raising the threshold increases the variance of estimators: a bias-variance trade-off. Many existing threshold selection methods do not address this trade-off directly, but rather aim to select the lowest threshold above which the GP model is judged to hold approximately. In this paper Bayesian cross-validation is used to address the trade-off by comparing thresholds based on predictive ability at extreme levels. Extremal inferences can be sensitive to the choice of a single threshold. We use Bayesian model-averaging to combine inferences from many thresholds, thereby reducing sensitivity to the choice of a single threshold. The methodology is applied to significant wave height datasets from the northern North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Keywords.},

abstract = {In statistical modelling, it is often important to know how much parameter estimates are influenced by particular observations. An attractive approach is to re-estimate the parameters with each observation deleted in turn, but this is computationally demanding when fitting models by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), as obtaining complete sample estimates is often in itself a very time-consuming task. Here we propose two efficient ways to approximate the case-deleted estimates by using output from MCMC estimation. Our first proposal, which directly approximates the usual influence statistics in maximum likelihood analyses of generalised linear models (GLMs), is easy to implement and avoids any further evaluation of the likelihood. Hence, unlike the existing alternatives, it does not become more computationally intensive as the model complexity increases. Our second proposal, which utilises model perturbations, also has this advantage and does not require the form of the GLM to be specified. We show how our two proposed methods are related and evaluate them against the existing method of importance sampling and case deletion in a logistic regression analysis with missing covariates. We also provide practical advice for those implementing our procedures, so that they may be used in many situations where MCMC is used to fit statistical models.

In recent years, population genetic analyses, which complement organismal approaches in advancing our understanding of local adaptation have become widespread.

Does local adaptation target the same genes in related species? Do loci responsible for local adaptation exhibit tradeoffs across environments? After discussing these questions we highlight important limitations to population genetic analyses including challenges with obtaining high quality data, deciding which loci are targets of selection, and limits to identifying the genetic basis of local adaptation.},

abstract = {1.Species' abundances vary in space and time. Describing these patterns is a cornerstone of macroecology. Moreover, trends in population size are an important criterion for the assessment of a species' conservation status. Since abundance trends are not homogeneous in space, we need to quantify variation in abundance trends across the geographical range of a species. A basic difficulty exists in that data sets that cover large geographic areas rarely include population abundance data at high temporal resolution. Whilst both broad-scale geographic distribution data and site specific population trend data are becoming more widely available, approaches are required that integrate these different types of data. 2. We present a hierarchical model that integrates observations from multiple sources to estimate spatio-temporal abundance trends. The model links annual population densities on a spatial grid to both long-term count data and to opportunistic occurrence records from a citizen-science programme. Specific observation models for both data types explicitly account for differences in data structure and quality. 3. We test this novel method in a virtual study with simulated data and apply it to the estimation of abundance dynamics across the range of a butterfly species (Pyronia tithonus) in Great Britain between 1985 and 2004. The application to simulated and real data demonstrates how the hierarchical model structure accommodates various sources of uncertainty that occur at different stages of the link between observational data and the modelled abundance. Thereby, it accounts for these uncertainties in the inference of abundance variations. 4. We show that by using hierarchical observation models that integrate different types of commonly available data sources we can improve estimates of variation in species abundances across space and time. This will improve our ability to detect regional trends and can also enhance the empirical basis for understanding range dynamics.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that affect water quality and the ecological services provided by freshwater ecosystems is an urgent global environmental issue. Predicting how water quality will respond to global changes not only requires water quality data, but also information about the ecological context of individual water bodies across broad spatial extents. Because lake water quality is usually sampled in limited geographic regions, often for limited time periods, assessing the environmental controls of water quality requires compilation of many data sets across broad regions and across time into an integrated database. LAGOS-NE accomplishes this goal for lakes in the northeastern-most 17 US states. LAGOS-NE contains data for 51101 lakes and reservoirs larger than 4 ha in 17 lake-rich US states. The database includes 3 datamodules for: lake location and physical characteristics for all lakes; ecological context (i.e., the land use, geologic, climatic, and hydrologic setting of lakes) for all lakes; and in situmeasurements of lake water quality for a subset of the lakes fromthe past 3 decades for approximately 2600–12 000 lakes depending on the variable. The database contains approximately 150000 measures of total phosphorus, 200 000 measures of chlorophyll, and 900 000 measures of Secchi depth. The water quality data were compiled from87 lake water quality data sets fromfederal, state, tribal, and non-profit agencies, university researchers, and citizen scientists. This database is one of the largest andmost comprehensive databases of its type because it includes both in situmeasurements and ecological context data. Because ecological context can be used to study a variety of other questions about lakes, streams, and wetlands, this database can also be used as the foundation for other studies of freshwaters at broad spatial and ecological scales},

Over 70{\%} of the EPA content in the esterified crude extract of microalgae were recovered at purities exceeding 90{\%}. The recovery scheme utilizes either wet or freeze-dried algal biomass. The process consists of only three main steps: 1) simultaneous extraction and transesterification of the algal biomass; 2) argentated silica gel column chromatography of the crude extract; and 3) removal of pigments by a second column chromatographic step. Argentated silica gel chromatography recovered about 70{\%} of the EPA ester present in the crude fatty ester mixture of fish oil, but at a reduced purity approximately 83{\%} pure) compared to the microalgal derived EPA. The optimal loading of the fatty ester mixture on the chromatographic support was about 3{\%} (w/w) but loadings up to 4{\%} did not affect the resolution significantly. The process was scaled up by a factor of nearly 320 by increasing the diameter of the chromatography columns. The elution velocity remained constant. Compared to the green alga Monodus subterraneus, the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum had important advantages as a potential commercial producer of EPA. For a microalgal EPA process to be competitive with fish oil derived EPA, P. tricornutum biomass (2.5{\%} w/w EPA) needs to be obtained at less than {\$}4/kg. If the EPA content in the alga are increased to 3.5{\%}, the biomass may command a somewhat higher price. The quality of microalgal EPA compares favorably with that of the fish oil product. Compared to free fatty acid, EPA ester is more stable in storage. Shelf-life is extended by storing in hexane. The silver contamination in the final purified EPA was negligibly small ({\textless}210 ppb).},

It is argued that it is most fruitful to consider models where network evolution is represented as the result of many (usually non-observed) small changes occurring between the consecutively observed networks. Accordingly, the focus is on models where a continuous-time network evolution is assumed although the observations are made at discrete time points (two or more). Three models are considered in detail, all based on the assumption that the observed networks are outcomes of a Markov process evolving in continuous time. The independent arcs model is a trivial baseline model. The reciprocity model expresses e ects of reciprocity, but lacks other structural e ects. The actor-oriented model is based on a model of actors changing their outgoing ties as a consequence of myopic stochastic optimization of an objective function. This framework o ers the exibility to represent a variety of network e ects. An estimation algorithm is treated, based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of the method of moments.},

abstract = {As an extension to the popular hidden Markov model (HMM), a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) allows the underlying stochastic process to be a semi-Markov chain. Each state has variable duration and a number of observations being produced while in the state. This makes it suitable for use in a wider range of applications. Its forward-backward algorithms can be used to estimate/update the model parameters, determine the predicted, filtered and smoothed probabilities, evaluate goodness of an observation sequence fitting to the model, and find the best state sequence of the underlying stochastic process. Since the HSMM was initially introduced in 1980 for machine recognition of speech, it has been applied in thirty scientific and engineering areas, such as speech recognition/synthesis, human activity recognition/prediction, handwriting recognition, functional MRI brain mapping, and network anomaly detection. There are about three hundred papers published in the literature. An overview of HSMMs is presented in this paper, including modelling, inference, estimation, implementation and applications. It first provides a unified description of various HSMMs and discusses the general issues behind them. The boundary conditions of HSMM are extended. Then the conventional models, including the explicit duration, variable transition, and residential time of HSMM, are discussed. Various duration distributions and observation models are presented. Finally, the paper draws an outline of the applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Stochastic actor-based models are models for network dynamics that can represent a wide variety of influences on network change, and allow to estimate parameters expressing such influences, and test corresponding hypotheses. The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process 'driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes ('actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes ('dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior. This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for model selection. Crown Copyright ?? 2009.},

abstract = {Use of accelerometers is now widespread within animal biotelemetry as they provide a means of measuring an animal's activity in a meaningful and quantitative way where direct observation is not possible. In sequential acceleration data there is a natural dependence between observations of movement or behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most analyses. Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been explicitly modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Depending on the aim of an analysis, either a supervised or an unsupervised learning approach can be applied. Under a supervised context, an HMM is trained to classify unlabelled acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories, whereas we will demonstrate how an unsupervised learning approach can be used to infer new aspects of animal behaviour. We will provide the details necessary to implement and assess an HMM in both the supervised and unsupervised context, and discuss the data requirements of each case. We outline two applications to marine and aerial systems (sharks and eagles) taking the unsupervised approach, which is more readily applicable to animal activity measured in the field. HMMs were used to infer the effects of temporal, atmospheric and tidal inputs on animal behaviour. Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify important correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence behaviour). The HMM framework is well suited to deal with the main features commonly observed in accelerometer data. The ability to combine direct observations of animals activity and combine it with statistical models which account for the features of accelerometer data offer a new way to quantify animal behaviour, energetic expenditure and deepen our insights into individual behaviour as a constituent of populations and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Efforts to draw inferences about species occurrence frequently account for false negatives, the common situation when individuals of a species are not detected even when a site is occupied. However, recent studies suggest the need to also deal with false positives, which occur when species are misidentified so that a species is recorded as detected when a site is unoccupied. Bias in estimators of occupancy, colonization, and extinction can be severe when false positives occur. Accordingly, we propose models that simultaneously account for both types of error. Our approach can be used to improve estimates of occupancy for study designs where a subset of detections is of a type or method for which false positives can be assumed to not occur. We illustrate properties of the estimators with simulations and data for three species of frogs. We show that models that account for possible misidentification have greater support (lower AIC for two species) and can yield substantially different occupancy estimates than those that do not. When the potential for misidentification exists, researchers should consider analytical techniques that can account for this source of error, such as those presented here.},

abstract = {Background: Clustering time-series data into discrete groups can improve prediction and provide insight into the nature of underlying, unobservable states of the system. However, temporal variation in probabilities of group occupancy, or the rates at which individuals move between groups, can obscure such signals. We use finite mixture and hidden Markov models (HMMs), two standard clustering techniques, to model long-term hourly movement data from Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi). Allowing for temporal heterogeneity in transition probabilities, a straightforward but little-used extension of the standard HMM framework, resolves some shortcomings of current models and clarifies the movement patterns of panthers. Results: Simulations and analyses of panther data showed that model misspecification (omitting important sources of variation) can lead to overfitting/overestimating the underlying number of movement states. Models incorporating temporal heterogeneity identify fewer underlying states, and can make out-of-sample predictions that capture observed diurnal and autocorrelated movement patterns exhibited by Florida panthers. Conclusion: Incorporating temporal heterogeneity improved goodness of fit and predictive capability as well as reducing the selected number of movement states closer to a biologically interpretable level, although there is further room for improvement here. Our results suggest that incorporating additional structure in statistical models of movement can allow more accurate assessment of appropriate model complexity.},

abstract = {In many animal societies, groups of individuals form stable social units that are shaped by well- delineated dominance hierarchies and a range of affiliative relationships. How do socially complex groups maintain cohesion and achieve collective movement? Using high-resolution GPS tracking of members of a wild baboon troop, we test whether collective movement in stable social groups is governed by interactions among local neighbours (commonly found in groups with largely anonymous memberships), social affiliates, and/or by individuals paying attention to global group structure. We construct candidate movement prediction models and evaluate their ability to predict the future trajectory of focal individuals. We find that baboon movements are best predicted by 4 to 6 neighbours. While these are generally individuals' nearest neighbours, we find that baboons have distinct preferences for particular neighbours, and that these social affiliates best predict individual location at longer time scales ({\textgreater}10 minutes). Our results support existing theoretical and empirical studies highlighting the importance of local rules in driving collective outcomes, such as collective departures, in primates. We extend previous studies by elucidating the rules that maintain cohesion in baboons ‘on the move', as well as the different temporal scales of social interactions that are at play.},

In particular, we introduce a hidden Markov-type modeling approach for time series comprising the depths of a diving marine mammal, thus modeling movement in the water column. We first develop a baseline Markov-switching model, which is then extended to incorporate feedback and semi-Markovian components, motivated by the observations made for a particular species, Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris). The application of the proposed model to the beaked whale data reveals both strengths and weaknesses of the suggested modeling framework.

These conditions are often met, in particular for data related to terrestrial animals, so that a likelihood-based HMM approach is feasible. We describe a number of extensions of HMMs for animal movement modeling, including more flexible state transition models and individual random effects (fitted in a non-Bayesian framework). In particular we consider so-called hidden semi-Markov models, which may substantially improve the goodness of fit and provide important insights into the behavioral state switching dynamics. To showcase the expediency of these methods, we consider an application of a hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model to multiple bison movement paths.},

The model builds on and extends the seminal work of Ferguson (1980) on variable duration models for speech. For the rainfall data the obser- vations are modelled as mixtures of log-normal distributions within unobserved states where the states evolve in time according to a semi-Markov process. For the latter, parametric forms need to be specified for the state transition probabilities and dwell-time distributions. Recursions for constructing the likelihood are developed and the EM algorithm used to fit the parameters of the model. The choice of dwell-time distribution is discussed with a mixture of distributions over disjoint domains providing a flex- ible alternative. The methods are also extended to deal with censored data. An application of the model to a large-scale bivariate dataset of breakpoint rainfall measurements at Wellington, New Zealand, is discussed.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

abstract = {Mass production of microalgae is currently limited by existing cultivation strategies, which rely heavily on open cultivation systems. Increasing lipid production in these systems while minimizing the invasion of non-target algae (competitors) and grazers (predators) will improve the economic viability of algal biofuel. In this study, we manipulate a basic environmental parameter, salinity, to promote algal growth and limit invading organisms. We monitor the growth of marine microalga Nannochloropsis salina and invasion of algal competitors and predators in open cultures grown at different salinities ranging from brackish to hypersaline. Algal growth and biomass was greatest at salinities of 22 and 34 PSU, whereas the density of invading organisms was lowest at 22 PSU. To determine if lipid accumulation could be maximized by salinity stress, we grew N. salina at 22 PSU until the populations were at stationary phase and then increased salinity to 34, 46, and 58 PSU. Gravimetrically determined lipid content increased significantly at these higher salinities, and was highest at 34 PSU (36{\%} dry tissue mass). Analysis of Folch extracts by FT-ICR mass spectrometry showed a monotonic increase in triglyceride content and decreased membrane lipid content with increased salinity. Together, this work demonstrates an ecological approach to overcome the current limitations of cultivation strategies.},

abstract = {Algae have significant potential as a source of biomass for the production of biofuels, due to their high growth rates and high cellular lipid content. Studies that address the use of algae as biofuels often require the frequent measurement of algal lipid content. Traditional methods for the quantification of lipid are, however, costly if sub-contracted, or involve the use of expensive analytical equipment that is not available in many labs. This study describes a simple, colorimetric method for the quantification of algal lipid from small amounts of culture. The technique is derived from a method for the quantification of fatty acids dissolved in chloroform. Algal lipids are saponified to fatty acids and then mixed with a copper reagent. Chloroform-extractable copper soaps of long-chain fatty acids are then colorimetrically measured by the addition of diethyldithiocarbamate to develop a yellow colored product. Linear responses for fatty acids in the range of C10:0 to C16:0 were observed for a concentration range between 0.025 and 1 micromol of fatty acid per 200 microL of sample. Fatty acids with chain lengths of less than twelve carbons produced significantly reduced signal. Decenoic acid yielded a slightly, but significantly lower signal than decanoic acid indicating that the assay underestimates the presence of unsaturated fatty acids. Lipid contents of Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Chlorella vulgaris CM2 were monitored for eight days during exponential growth to demonstrate the feasibility of the technique as a monitoring methodology. Overall, the method allowed reliable detection and quantification of fatty acid content from 1 to 2 mL of algal culture. Adaptation of the technique to micro-centrifuge format allows assaying 30 samples in less than 2h. Considering reagents and time, the total cost per assay was estimated at less than {\$}5, representing a significant cost savings over traditional lipid quantification procedures.},

Extensive simulations are used to demonstrate the reasons that render order selection particularly challenging in practice despite the conceptual simplicity of the task. In particular, we demonstrate why well-established formal procedures for model selection, such as those based on standard information criteria, tend to favor models with numbers of states that are undesirably large in situations where states shall be meaningful entities. We also offer a pragmatic step-by-step approach together with comprehensive advice for how practitioners can implement order selection.

In this article, we examine the application of this framework in a variety of contexts, using examples from the scientific literature.

abstract = {There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the ubiquitous Hidden Markov Model for learning from sequential and time-series data. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markovianity, which has been developed mainly in the parametric frequentist setting, to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semi-Markov Model (HDP-HSMM) and develop sampling algorithms for efficient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide new methods for sampling inference in the finite Bayesian HSMM. Our modular Gibbs sampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesian models, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesian inference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inference methods on both synthetic and real experiments.},

In recent years studies on the lipid biochemistry of algae has shifted from experiments with a few model organisms to encompass a much larger number of, often unusual, algae. This has led to the discovery of new compounds, including major membrane components, as well as the elucidation of lipid signalling pathways. A major drive in recent research have been attempts to discover genes that code for expression of the various proteins involved in the production of very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. Such work is described here together with information about how environmental factors, such as light, temperature or minerals, can change algal lipid metabolism and how adaptation may take place.},

abstract = {With the influx of complex and detailed tracking data gathered from electronic tracking devices, the analysis of animal movement data has recently emerged as a cottage industry amongst biostatisticians. New approaches of ever greater complexity are continue to be added to the literature. In this paper, we review what we believe to be some of the most popular and most useful classes of statistical models used to analyze individual animal movement data. Specifically we consider discrete-time hidden Markov models, more general state-space models and diffusion processes. We argue that these models should be core components in the toolbox for quantitative researchers working on stochastic modelling of individual animal movement. The paper concludes by offering some general observations on the direction of statistical analysis of animal movement. There is a trend in movement ecology toward what are arguably overly-complex modelling approaches which are inaccessible to ecologists, unwieldy with large data sets or not based in mainstream statistical practice. Additionally, some analysis methods developed within the ecological community ignore fundamental properties of movement data, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about animal movement. Corresponding approaches, e.g. based on L$\backslash$'evy walk-type models, continue to be popular despite having been largely discredited. We contend that there is a need for an appropriate balance between the extremes of either being overly complex or being overly simplistic, whereby the discipline relies on models of intermediate complexity that are usable by general ecologists, but grounded in well-developed statistical practice and efficient to fit to large data sets.},

abstract = {While there is good evidence linking animal introductions to impacts on native communities via disease emergence, our understanding ofhowsuch impacts occur is incomplete. Invasion ecologists have focused on the disease risks to native communities through ‘‘spillover'' of infectious agents introduced with nonindigenous hosts, while overlooking a potentially more common mechanism of impact, that of ‘‘parasite spillback.'' We hypothesize that parasite spillback could occur when a nonindigenous species is a competent host for a native parasite, with the presence of the additional host increasing disease impacts in native species. Despite its lack of formalization in all recent reviews of the role of parasites in species introductions, aspects of the invasion process actually favor parasite spillback over spillover.Wespecifically review the animal-parasite literature and show that native species (arthropods, parasitoids, protozoa, and helminths) account for 67{\%} of the parasite fauna of nonindigenous animals from a range of taxonomic groups. Weshow that nonindigenous species can be highly competent hosts for such parasites and provide evidence that infection by native parasites does spillback from nonindigenous species to native host species, with effects at both the host individual and population scale. We conclude by calling for greater recognition of parasite spillback as a potential threat to native species, discuss possible reasons for its neglect by invasion ecologists, and identify future research directions.},

abstract = {The term data augmentation refers to methods for constructing iterative optimization or sampling algorithms via the introduction of unobserved data or latent variables. For deterministic algorithms, the method was popularized in the general statistical community by the seminal article by Dempster, Laird, and Rubin on the EM algorithm for maximizing a likelihood function or, more generally, a posterior density. For stochastic algorithms, the method was popularized in the statistical literature by Tanner and Wong's Data Augmentation algorithm for posterior sampling and in the physics literature by Swendsen and Wang's algorithm for sampling from the Ising and Potts models and their generalizations; in the physics literature, the method of data augmentation is referred to as the method of auxiliary variables. Data augmentation schemes were used by Tanner and Wong to make simulation feasible and simple, while auxiliary variables were adopted by Swendsen and Wang to improve the speed of iterative simulation. In general, however, constructing data augmentation schemes that result in both simple and fast algorithms is a matter of art in that successful strategies vary greatly with the (observed-data) models being considered. After an overview of data augmentation/auxiliary variables and some recent developments in methods for constructing such efficient data augmentation schemes, we introduce an effective search strategy that combines the ideas of marginal augmentation and conditional augmentation, together with a deterministic approximation method for selecting good augmentation schemes. We then apply this strategy to three common classes of models (specifically, multivariate t, probit regression, and mixed-effects models) to obtain efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior sampling. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the resulting algorithms, while requiring similar programming effort, can show dramatic improvement over the Gibbs samplers commonly used for these models in practice. A key feature of all these new algorithms is that they are positive recurrent subchains of nonpositive recurrent Markov chains constructed in larger spaces.},

In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the “Chinese restaurant franchise.” We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling.},

abstract = {All animals detect osmotic and mechanical stimuli, but the molecular basis for these responses is incompletely understood. The vertebrate transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily 4 (TRPV4) (VR-OAC) cation channel has been suggested to be an osmo/mechanosensory channel. To assess its function in vivo, we expressed TRPV4 in Caenorhabditis elegans sensory neurons and examined its ability to generate behavioral responses to sensory stimuli. C. elegans ASH neurons function as polymodal sensory neurons that generate a characteristic escape behavior in response to mechanical, osmotic, or olfactory stimuli. These behaviors require the TRPV channel OSM-9 because osm-9 mutants do not avoid nose touch, high osmolarity, or noxious odors. Expression of mammalian TRPV4 in ASH neurons of osm-9 worms restored avoidance responses to hypertonicity and nose touch, but not the response to odorant repellents. Mutations known to reduce TRPV4 channel activity also reduced its ability to direct nematode avoidance behavior. TRPV4 function in ASH required the endogenous C. elegans osmotic and nose touch avoidance genes ocr-2, odr-3, osm-10, and glr-1, indicating that TRPV4 is integrated into the normal ASH sensory apparatus. The osmotic and mechanical avoidance responses of TRPV4-expressing animals were different in their sensitivity and temperature dependence from the responses of wild-type animals, suggesting that the TRPV4 channel confers its characteristic properties on the transgenic animals' behavior. These results provide evidence that TRPV4 can function as a component of an osmotic/mechanical sensor in vivo.},

abstract = {The stereotyped mating behaviour of the Caenorhabditis elegans male is made up of several substeps: response, backing, turning, vulva location, spicule insertion and sperm transfer. The complexity of this behaviour is reflected in the sexually dimorphic anatomy and nervous system. Behavioural functions have been assigned to most of the male-specific sensory neurons by means of cell ablations; for example, the hook sensory neurons HOA and HOB are specifically required for vulva location. We have investigated how sensory perception of the hermaphrodite by the C. elegans male controls mating behaviours. Here we identify a gene, lov-1 (for location of vulva), that is required for two male sensory behaviours: response and vulva location. lov-1 encodes a putative membrane protein with a mucin-like, serine-threonine-rich amino terminus followed by two blocks of homology to human polycystins, products of the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney-disease loci PKD1 and PKD2. LOV-1 is the closest C. elegans homologue of PKD1. lov-1 is expressed in adult males in sensory neurons of the rays, hook and head, which mediate response, vulva location, and potentially chemotaxis to hermaphrodites, respectively. PKD-2, the C. elegans homologue of PKD2, is localized to the same neurons as LOV-1, suggesting that they function in the same pathway.},

abstract = {MTV: Music Television, the US music channel, has expanded its operations globally, launching derivative services in other regions, including MTV Europe, MTV Asia and MTV Latino. This expansion raises concerns about US cultural influence abroad since MTV's programs mostly play American and British artists or local acts that mimic US music styles. The history, operations and programming of MTV's various international services are surveyed. MTV seeks to foster and exploit an international youth culture. The part cooperative, part contentious relationship between MTV and transnational record companies is explored. Finally, alternatives to MTV like Canada's Much Music are considered. },
